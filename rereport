Company Name: Salani Bus Service.
•	Short Summary of Our Bus Service 
Salani Bus Service is a public transportation system that provides scheduled routes and timetables for passengers to travel within the cities and different towns in our region.
Improvements made from part 1 to part 2/ Fixed mistakes  
The improvements that I had to make are as follows: 
I had to write/add the titles in between the <title>Tags</title> and I had to complete the spelling of the <title> because it was incomplete I had typed <titl> instead of <title><title>. 
I had to correct the spelling of my image folder i had made an spelling error i had named my folder imgages instead of images. 
	Navigation Bar: 
I had to remove the <br> tags in between the links. Instead of using the <br> tag i had to wrap all my links using the <ul> tag. 
	Contact Page: 
I added some few things on my contact page that were not there on part 1, I had to add the social medias and thew comment section where the users will comment and stay connect with our service. 
I had to add the gallery folder so that the customer can relate to our services.
